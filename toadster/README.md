# Toadster

## About

Toadster is an implementation of a [Component Graph System](https://github.com/kvark/froggy/wiki/Component-Graph-System) (CGS). It is inspired by [Froggy](https://crates.io/crates/froggy).

This project was started out of the wish to experiment, and to meet the specific needs of [Von Neumann Defense Force](https://github.com/hannobraun/vndf). There might not be much reason to use this library over Froggy.
