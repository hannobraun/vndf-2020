# Rinnsal

## About

Rinnsal is a game event library, purpose-built for the needs of [Von Neumann Defense Force](https://github.com/hannobraun/vndf). So far, those needs have not been very demanding, making the functionality provided by this library pretty trivial. If you don't have the intention of working on Von Neumann Defense Force, your best bet is probably to ignore this completely.

The name is the German word for a small stream (runnel, trickle, runlet). It was chosen because the original plan was to build this library on [`futures::Stream`](https://docs.rs/futures/0.3.4/futures/stream/trait.Stream.html). So far, this hasn't been realized.
